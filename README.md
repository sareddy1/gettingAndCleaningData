Peer Graded Assignment

The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following

1. Download the dataset 
2. Load the activity and feature data
3. Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
4. Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset, and merges those columns with the dataset
5. Merges the two datasets
6. Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
7. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.

The final output file is TidyData.txt
